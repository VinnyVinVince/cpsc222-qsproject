# Quantified Self Project

## Usage
Refer to the main Jupyter Notebook report file. Cleaned data and utility code
provided, though the lack of raw data files may cause errors in directly running
the code provided in the report (the input datasets have been omitted for
privacy). The utility file cleaning functions should be compatible with any 
Discord channel-specific CSV file derived an account's message
history data.

## Organization
* DiscordDataProject.ipynb - Hypothesis testing and data analysis report
* utils.py - Utility functions code (e.g. cleaning, aggregation)
* vin_data_cleaned.csv - Vincent's cleaned message data
* kev_data_cleaned.csv - Kevin's cleaned message data
